     <h1>Software Engineering </h1>
	  <p class="text">
<font color="orange">
         The engineering field has taken on many new discilpine as scientific knowledge has grown. The latest discipline is software engineering.
According to the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) software engineering means applying the principle of engineering to the software 
development field.
softaware engineering differs from other branches of engineering in that professional are building an intangible structure and not a tangible 
one since software is embedded in the machine used in various industries though malfunctioning software can actually have tangible effect. With 
software used in everything from medical equipment to airplanes the end result of faulty software can indeedbe loss of life.
even nonembedded software impact many areas of our lives.
We routinly trust software with our financial information and password .We use it to run our bisinesses and conduct our work activities .Yet it far from
foolproof. There may be hackers or system overload. Then there are the times that the software works from a technical standpoint but fail to give a good user experiance.
Software engineering often does involve writing code but this is only stage in the process .True software engineering has a well articluted life cycle.
	
	  
	
     <h2>THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROCESS?</h2>
	  <p class="text">

               <font color="orange">When software projects require engineering the process being long before the product is designed and it continues long afterward. it begins with a through study of tyhe software requirment.Some requirment 
involves the function the program need to carry out.THE program may for example system already in place.
 The next stage is software design .This involves creating algorithm or instruction for the computer.The actual coding process may be completed by software engineer who have comprehensive training, or by programmers linear 
manner ,they may be organized in a variety of ways including spirling.</font></p>
    <h2> WHAT TYPE OF SOFTWARE REQUIRE ENGINIEERING?</h2>
  <p class="text">
	<font color="orange">A systematic and disciplined approch is necessary for every endover.You do not need enginieering training to design a simple gme or aprogram that teaches your child to read.You do need it though to creat high stakes
software for the defens department.
Businesses also empoly software engineer to creat customized softwareand addres valunerbalities before they happen. This make sense when we think of the complexity of the tasks that the professional carries out 
tasks like holding meeting in real time with collaborators oceans away.Even when engineering priniciple arent necessary for safety sound design can increase sffciency and decreases costs.

     <h2> EDUCATION AND JOB PROSPECT FOR SOFTWARE ENGUNEERS</h2>
<font color="orange">There are two main branches of software engineering.Application software creat and maintain computer application.system software enfgineer analyz technicals need department and computer or maintain apporopriate system.Setting up and maintaning internet system would fall under thier scope.
<br>
Software engineering is a growing field even during difficult economic times.The Bureau of labour statistcs report that while employers may outsources some position ,outsourcing is less likely to occr in highly specilized computer and softwarte 
engineering position than in lower lebel programming position.
<br>
There are exciting opportunities for those with an educationl background in software engineering, computer science,software development computer engineering and similar disciplone. Check out some of the potential career path. 
<br>
software engineer training onlineSoftware Engineers develop computer systems and applications.
<br>
Software engineers design, develop and improve upon the computer programs we use every day, including business apps, operating systems, network control systems and social networks. Software engineers can be divided into two main classifications: Applications Software Engineers and Systems Software Engineers.
<br>
Applications software engineers analyze an end-user's needs and develop a custom program to meet those needs. They use a range of programming languages depending on the application's parameters and the platform on which the program runs. Modern languages used by applications software engineers include Java, C, C++, PHP, Objective-C, Perl and Python. Mobile app developers are specialized applications software engineers who create apps for smartphones and tablets.
<br>
Systems software engineers coordinate the creation, maintenance and expansion of an organization's internal computer systems. They organize the computing needs of each department, such as sales, inventory, billing & payroll, and control the technical direction of the computer system's development. Systems software engineers may also be responsible for developing a company's intranet and ensuring system security.
<br>
Universities and private tech schools offer a range of software engineer training courses and accredited degrees in system and application development. Compare the top-rated software engineer training programs in the U.S., Canada and online.

     <h1> Hardware Engineering</h1>
	 <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
	  <p class="text">
          <font color="orange"> computer hardware is the collection of physical part of a computer system. The includes the computer case, monitor, keyboard and mouse. It also includes the computer case , such as the hard disk drive, motherboard, video card, and many others. computer hardware is what you can physically touch.
A computer system consist of two major elements hardware and software.Computer hardware is the collection of all parts you can physiclly touch. Computer software on the hand is not sommething you can touch. Software is a set of instruction for a computer to perform specific operation. You need both hardware and software for a computer system to work.
Some hardware components are easy to recognize such as the computer case , keyboard  and monitor. However there are many different types of hardware component. In lesson, you will learn to recognize the different componenet and what they do.
</font>
	  </p>
<h2> HARDWARE COMPONENT?</h2>
 <font color="orange"> 
Let start with the computer case. The is the metal enclouser that contain many of the other hardware component. It comes in various shapes and size, but a typical tower model is between 15-25 inches high. Want io know whats inside? Okay, go get a screwdriver and let open it up. Seriously, if you are really into computer, the best way to learn is to actually get hands-on. To save us some  
time, however, have a look at this desktop computer case. A computer enthusisat replaced the metals side panel with a transparent one, so we can have a look inside.
Although that photo looks pretty cool, it is a bit hard to recognize the individual component especially with all the connecting wires running through it . This figure showes a more schematic version of a desktop computer, which makes it easier to point out the essential hardware component.
