     <h1>WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING ?</h1>
	  <p class="text">
           The BLS predicats employment of computer hardware engineer to grow 7 precent from 2012 to 2022 which is slower than the average for all occuption."A limited number of engineer will be needed to meet the demand for new computer hardware because 
more og the technology innovation takes place with software than with hardware the BLS state.
Employment of software develpment is projected to grow 22 percent from 2012 to 2022 which is much faster than the average for all occupation.
"The main reason for the rapid growth is a large increse in the demand for computer software according to the BLShaving good grades from a highly rated institution should give a job seeker an advantage over the competition.
